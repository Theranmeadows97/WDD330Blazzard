    <h3>Week 6 Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="To-Do-List-master/index.html">To-Do Application: GRADE THIS ONE PLEASE</a></li>
        <p>I tried to add a feature where you could click the item and it would turn red. I was unable to isolate each element though as any click will only change the first item in the list. </p>
        <li><a href="todo/todoApp.html">To-Do Application Option B</a></li>
        <p>SASS was very interesting to work with. It was my first time. I really want to learn more about it though.</p>
        <li><a href="dragAndDropPractice/dragAndDrop.html">Drag and Drop Practice</a></li>
        <p>This was a feature i wanted to add but found it a little difficult to implement. That seems to be my biggest weakness when learning a new concept, is implementing it with previous concepts I learned.</p>
    </ul>
