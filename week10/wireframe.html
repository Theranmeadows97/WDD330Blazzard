    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Personal/ Professional Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For my project proposal, I would like to make a fully responsive personal/ portfolio website to showcase more of my selected works and projects. I would also like to add a professional section where I can add my resume along with an “about me” section to give more information from a casual point of view.</p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I feel that I still need to refine and expand my skills in HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, and the principles of design. This will also help me to prepare for a professional career as a web developer as I want this to be something I can include in my experience when applying to a job.</p>
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience will be those whom I will work with in a professional setting both superiors and co-workers.</p>
    <h3>Data Structures</h3>
    <p>I will use local JSON files for pages that will be regularly updated.</p>
    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>I got inspiration from these sites that featured 10 portfolio websites: <a href="https://junocollege.com/blog/10-amazing-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you " target="_blank">here</a></p>
